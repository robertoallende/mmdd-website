# Unit 07: Build Integration

## Objective
Optimize markdown processing for production builds, ensure static HTML generation works correctly, and test that build output matches development functionality with proper asset handling.

## Implementation
Enhance build system for production deployment:

### Build Process Optimization:
- Test `npm run build` creates proper static files in dist/
- Verify markdown processing works in production build
- Ensure all 5 content sections are correctly generated
- Confirm CSS and JS assets are properly bundled

### Static HTML Generation:
- Validate that build output contains processed markdown content
- Check that no runtime markdown processing is required
- Ensure all HTML is static and ready for deployment
- Verify tab navigation works in built files

### Asset Handling Verification:
- Confirm CSS files are properly minified and linked
- Test JavaScript functionality in production build
- Verify font loading and background images work
- Check that all paths are correctly resolved

### Production Testing:
- Use `npm run preview` to test production build locally
- Compare development vs production functionality
- Ensure performance is optimized for static hosting
- Test on different browsers if possible

### Build Output Structure:
```
dist/
├── index.html (with processed markdown content)
├── assets/
│   ├── index-[hash].css (minified styles)
│   └── index-[hash].js (minified scripts)
└── [other static assets]
```

## AI Interactions
Systematic build integration approach:
1. Run production build and analyze output
2. Test build with npm run preview
3. Compare dev vs production functionality
4. Fix any build-specific issues found
5. Optimize for static site hosting
6. Document build process for deployment

## Files Modified
**Testing Commands:**
- `npm run build` (create production build)
- `npm run preview` (test production build)

**Potential Updates:**
- vite.config.js (build optimizations if needed)
- package.json (build scripts if needed)

## Status: Complete
Successfully tested and optimized production build integration. All markdown processing works correctly in production, assets are properly bundled and linked, and build output is ready for static hosting deployment.
