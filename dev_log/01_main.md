# Project Plan and Dev Log

Convert an existing static HTML website to use Markdown files for content management, using Vite to generate static HTML at build time while preserving the existing design and functionality.

## Structure

This project follows MMDD methodology with units representing major development phases. Each unit contains discrete tasks that build incrementally toward the final goal. Units 01-09 handle core functionality, Units 10-11 focus on SEO optimization.

## About the Project

### What This Is
A conversion of the MMDD methodology website from a single static HTML file to a modern Vite-based static site generator that processes Markdown content at build time. The site will maintain its existing tabbed navigation design and styling while enabling easier content management through separate .md files.

### Architecture
```
src/
├── index.html (main template with current design)
├── content/
│   ├── home.md
│   ├── how-it-works.md
│   ├── news.md
│   ├── community.md
│   └── about.md
├── js/
│   └── main.js (tab navigation and markdown rendering)
└── css/
    └── styles.css (extracted from inline styles)
```

Build-time processing converts Markdown to HTML and injects into the template. Final output is pure static HTML/CSS/JS for deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Technical Stack
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Content:** Markdown with frontmatter support
- **Processing:** marked (Markdown parser), gray-matter (frontmatter)
- **Styling:** Existing CSS (extracted from inline)
- **JavaScript:** Plain JS (no TypeScript needed)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages with custom domain (mmdd.dev)
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4
- **Domain:** HTTPS via GitHub Pages custom domain

## Project Status
