## Micromanaged Driven Development v2.0

We're excited to announce the release of MMDD Version 2! This release focuses on organizational improvements, better consistency, and streamlined adoption.

**What's New:** Improved file organization with renamed core principles file (00_mdd.md → 00_mmdd.md), enhanced documentation with updated internal references, and project cleanup removing unimplemented units. The methodology now shows 85% completion status with core principles, templates, and real-world validation complete.

**Getting Started:** New users can download the latest principles with `curl -O https://mmdd.dev/00_mmdd.md`. Existing users should update references from 00_mdd.md to 00_mmdd.md and review the updated principles.
