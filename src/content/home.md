# Build all your code with AI — and keep full control.

AI-assisted coding is fast — but unpredictable.
It can deliver working code today, but leave you with fragile systems tomorrow: little understanding, no audit trail, and poor maintainability.

## Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD)
MMDD is an open-source methodology for AI-assisted software development.
It enables you to use AI for every line of code while staying in charge of every decision.
By breaking work into small, reviewable steps and documenting each one, MMDD turns AI into a reliable partner — producing maintainable, understandable, and predictable results.

### MMDD solves that problem by:

- Forcing small, reviewable steps → fewer regressions, easier rollbacks.
- Documenting AI interactions → knowledge that lasts, not just ephemeral prompts.
- Maintaining control → every change is your decision; AI stays on-script.

### The result:
For teams: less costly rework, faster onboarding, maintainable codebases.
For founders: AI that ships faster without creating chaos.
Get Started

## Quick Start 

```bash
# 1. Create a development log folder
mkdir dev_log && cd dev_log

# 2. Download the MMDD principles guide
wget https://mmdd.dev/00_mmdd.md

# 3. Save the bootstrap prompt for your AI
cat > bootstrap-prompt.txt << 'EOF'
Using the template and methodology in dev_log/00_mmdd.md,
generate a 00_main.md file for my project that [describe your project].
Work in small, reviewable steps and clearly document decisions, alternatives, and next actions.
