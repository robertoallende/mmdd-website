# MMDD Architecture & Workflow

## Framework Architecture

MMDD follows a micromanaged, distributed architecture designed for maximum control, scalability, and maintainability in high-stress production environments.

## Core Design Principles

<div class="data-readout">
<strong>MODULARITY:</strong> Component-based architecture with clear boundaries<br>
<strong>MAINTAINABILITY:</strong> Clean, documented, and testable codebase<br>
<strong>DEPLOYABILITY:</strong> One-command deployment with rollback capabilities<br>
<strong>DURABILITY:</strong> Fault-tolerant design with automatic recovery
</div>

## Development Workflow

- Initialize project structure and dependencies
- Configure application parameters and protocols
- Implement business logic with framework support
- Execute comprehensive testing suite
- Deploy through automated pipeline
- Monitor performance and scale dynamically
