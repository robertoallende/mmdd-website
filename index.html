                    <h1>Build all your code with AI — and keep full control.</h1>
<p>AI-assisted coding is fast — but unpredictable.
It can deliver working code today, but leave you with fragile systems tomorrow: little understanding, no audit trail, and poor maintainability.</p>
<h2>Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD)</h2>
<p>MMDD is an open-source methodology for AI-assisted software development.
It enables you to use AI for every line of code while staying in charge of every decision.
By breaking work into small, reviewable steps and documenting each one, MMDD turns AI into a reliable partner — producing maintainable, understandable, and predictable results.</p>
<h3>MMDD solves that problem by:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forcing small, reviewable steps → fewer regressions, easier rollbacks.</li>
<li>Documenting AI interactions → knowledge that lasts, not just ephemeral prompts.</li>
<li>Maintaining control → every change is your decision; AI stays on-script.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The result:</h3>
<p>For teams: less costly rework, faster onboarding, maintainable codebases.
For founders: AI that ships faster without creating chaos.
Get Started</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># 1. Create a development log folder
mkdir dev_log &amp;&amp; cd dev_log

# 2. Download the MMDD principles guide
wget https://mmdd.dev/00_mmdd.md

# 3. Save the bootstrap prompt for your AI
cat &gt; bootstrap-prompt.txt &lt;&lt; &#39;EOF&#39;
Using the template and guidelines in dev_log/00_mmdd.md,
generate a 00_main.md file for my project that [describe your project].
Work in small, reviewable steps and clearly document decisions, alternatives, and next actions.
EOF

                    <h1>How It Works</h1>
<p>Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD) turns AI from an unpredictable code generator into a reliable partner by combining granular control with systematic documentation.
Instead of starting with a broad, open-ended request to the AI and hoping for the best, MMDD breaks work into small, reviewable units. At every stage, you review and iterate with the AI until the result matches your intent — before moving on.</p>
<h2>The MMDD Loop</h2>
<p>Plan → Define → Implement
Review &amp; iterate with AI at every step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan – At the start of a project, state clearly what you want to build. For each new unit, work with the AI to define its scope: ask what it’s about, explore possible decisions, choose your direction, and document your choices.</li>
<li>Define – Ask the AI to write the unit in detail. Review and refine until it’s exactly what you want.</li>
<li>Implement – Tell the AI: “Implement this unit.” Test the generated code, review it, and make adjustments as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Predictable AI results – Controlled scope reduces hallucinations.</li>
<li>Maintainable code – Documentation creates a permanent audit trail.</li>
<li>Faster onboarding – New developers can trace the “why” behind every change.</li>
<li>Confidence in changes – Small steps mean safer, reversible decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>MMDD works!</em> — MMDD itself was defined using MMDD. Even this website was built with MMDD, with every prompt, change, and decision recorded in its commit history.
See it in action on GitHub and try it on your next AI coding session.</p>

                    <h1>MMDD Framework Origins &amp; Mission</h1>
<h2>Development History</h2>
<p>The Micromanaged Driven Development Framework emerged from necessity - a team of engineers frustrated with the complexity, unpredictability, and maintenance overhead of existing development solutions. Initially developed as an internal tool at a major technology corporation, the framework quickly demonstrated superior performance, developer experience, and operational reliability.</p>
<p>Recognizing its potential impact on the broader development community, the core team made the strategic decision to open-source the project in early 2024, establishing it as a public benefit initiative focused on bringing enterprise-grade development practices to teams of all sizes.</p>
<h2>AWS Architecture Blog Feature</h2>
<p>Our architectural patterns and implementation strategies have been prominently featured in the official AWS Architecture Blog, highlighting MMDD&#39;s enterprise readiness and cloud-native design principles:</p>
<p><a href="#">&quot;Building Scalable, Resilient Applications with MMDD on AWS Infrastructure&quot;</a></p>
<h2>Core Team &amp; Leadership</h2>
<p>MMDD is maintained by a distributed team of senior engineers with extensive backgrounds at leading technology companies. Our collective mission focuses on creating development tools that enhance productivity while maintaining system reliability and operational excellence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead Architect - Former Google Cloud Platform infrastructure team</li>
