# About

## The Origin Story

MMDD was developed while building [CodeRipple](https://github.com/robertoallende/coderipple), a serverless application for the AWS Lambda Hackathon 2025. The goal was to generate 100% of the code using GenAI.

AI gives you working code fast, but modifications often break everything. Each change risked breaking the entire system with no clear path back to working code.

MMDD emerged as the solution - systematic micromanagement through granular control, comprehensive documentation, and iterative validation. CodeRipple became a production-grade serverless application with eight Lambda functions and event-driven architecture, all generated through systematic AI collaboration.

## MMDD in Practice

CodeRipple validated MMDD's effectiveness on complex systems. The project included cross-platform dependency management, Lambda Layers optimization, EventBridge orchestration, and AI-powered code analysis. Every architectural decision was systematically documented and AI-orchestrated through MDD methodology.

The methodology's three core principles proved essential when AI models suggested conflicting approaches. MMDD's systematic approach made LLM outputs deterministic and reinforced that documentation is essential for AI context and quality.
